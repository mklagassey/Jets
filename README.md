# OOP - Jet Manager Application

## ---Overview---
You're the manager of a jet airfield, complete with different types of jets, including: cargo, passenger and even military aircraft! You start with 5 jets, each with its own unique, real-world capabilities. List them all to see their stats or simply choose the fastest or longest endurance ones. You can add or remove jets too and when you really want to show off, fly your whole fleet!

### Technology used:
-Java -Conditionals -Looping -Input validation -ArrayLists -Inheritance
-Interfaces -Output formatting -Abstract classes -File reading

### Topics covered:
-Input/Output Streams -Exceptions -OOP: Abstraction and Interfaces

### Lessons learned:
The power of inheritance is starting to become more obvious now, I see that it makes things a lot more modular and easily modifiable without having to worry if we broke something somewhere else. Of particular interest is how bringing in outside resources and information from files (or other I/O streams) can be a game-changer with regard to usability (or replay value, in the case of a game).

### To Do
1) Work on stretch goals
2) Create more airfields and fly jets from one to the other, updating their respective fleets accordingly
3) Use the logic to build a more visually interesting sim
